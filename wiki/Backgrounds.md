# Skinning #
Since version 1.0.4.5 you can use custom backgrounds.
If you want to contribute - send me your backgrounds (herhor@o2.pl) and I will put them here next to your nickname.


## how-to ##
Just put your image (png, bmp, jpg, gif) into "background" folder in the same location as application executable (GWatch.exe).
Pop-up size will be adjusted to the image size, so you have a few options:
  * if you want a normal popup your image should be about 290x97px
  * if you want to use wide popup your image should be about 540x54px
  * if you want to use single mode (display only gmail or only reader), your image should be about 290x50px

## sample backgrounds ##
Here are some sample backgrounds (I'm not a graphic designer!).
They are also included in the latest release zip (in downloads).
