**Why am I getting a notofication about unread email, when there's 0 unread in my gmail mail-box?**

I'm taking the counter from the gmail feed url (https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom/unread) so if it shows you an incorrect number - there must be some unread emails somewhere in your inbox that are not showing.

Please go to this url (https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom/unread) in your browser (you must be logged in to your gmail) and view the source of that page (it's xml).
You should see some details of those unread emails.
